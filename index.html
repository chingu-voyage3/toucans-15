	<p class="what-is-p1"><strong>Ticky</strong>Bot is a Slack Bot ðŸ¤– that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, if you don't feel like it.</p>
</div>

<div class="flex-1">
	<p class="what-is-p2">With <strong>Ticky</strong>Bot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.</p>
</div>


	<p class="what-is-p3">Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.<br>
	<i>Image about someone asking silly questions and the workplace admin asking him/her to open a support ticket so other admins could look into the issue.</i></p>
