	<p class="two"><strong>TickyBot</strong> is a Slack Bot that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, if you don't feel like it.</p>

	<p class="three">With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.</p>

	<p>Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.<br>
