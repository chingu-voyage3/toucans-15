	<h1 class="what-is-title">What is <strong>Ticky</strong>Bot</h1>
	

	<p class="what-is-p1"><strong>TickyBot</strong> is a Slack Bot that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, if you don't feel like it.</p>

	<p class="what-is-p2">With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.</p>

	
	<p class="what-is-p3">Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.<br>
	<i>Image about someone asking silly questions and the workplace admin asking him/her to open a support ticket so other admins could look into the issue.</i></p>

	<h1>How It Works</h1>
	
	<p>You can add TickyBot to your Slack workplace by scrolling down or  <a href="www.google.com">clicking here</a></p>
	
	<p>Your users can open a ticket by typing /ticket and their message into the chat field</p>
